# ::cluster::mount::add -- Mount external source
#
#      This procedure will arrange for mounting a source onto a destination.
#      Mounting is done to the best of our capability and behaviour can be
#      adapted through the -order option. This option takes a list of methods
#      for mounting and these will be proven in turns. Allows techniques are the
#      keywords internal and external. External mounting uses FUSE and is only
#      available on UNIX-like system, internal mounting uses Tcl VFS
#      capabilities, when present. All other options are given further to the
#      internal or external mounting implementations. 
#
# Arguments:
#      src      Source of information, a remote URL or a local (archive) file
#      dst      Where to mount, this can be an internal to process path
#      args     Dash-led options and their values, only -order understood here.
#
# Results:
#      Return how the mount was performed, or an empty string when mounting was
#      not possible.
#
# Side Effects:
#      External mounting will make available the content of the remote resouce
#      or file to other processes own by the user for the life-time of the
#      operation. 
proc ::cluster::mount::add { src dst args } {

    # mounting...

#
# Arguments:
#      fname    Path to file to detect origin of

#
# Results:
#      One of the string internal, external or empty string
#
# Side Effects:
#      None.

# ::cluster::mount::access -- Cache in file/dir
#
#      The base logic is to arrange for caching a copy of a file or directory in

#      be able to use the file(s).  In short, this procedure arranges for files
#      that are internally mounted within this process to become accessible to
#      external processes that are spawn.
#
# Arguments:
#      fname    Name of file/dir to make accessible.
#      tmpdir   Temporary directory to store at, good default if empty
#      force    Force copy
#
# Results:
#      Return a path location that will be accessible to external processes,
#      this might be the same location as the original file path when it is
#      mounted externally (and not forced to caching)
#
# Side Effects:
#      None.

    # If the file is placed under an internally mounted VFS, we force caching so
    # that it can be made available to other processes.

# ::cluster::mount::AddInternal -- Inter-process mount
#

# Arguments:

#      dst      Where to mount, this can be an internal to process path
#      args     Dash-led options and their values, but none supported yet.
#
# Results:
#      1 on mount success, 0 otherwise
